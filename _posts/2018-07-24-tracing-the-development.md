For nearly all of my adult life, a large part of my job has involved communicating technical concepts.  I like to imagine that I've developed a consistent voice, style, and visual language, and I'm also inclined to imagine that it has taken me a long time to get here.  I recently needed to look over an old deck and was surprised to note that many elements of my current (and presumably at least somewhat refined) style were present in a talk I gave over a decade ago as a graduate student.

Here's [the old talk](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~willb/dimple/ppdp07-talk.pdf); for comparison, here's [a talk I gave this January](https://chapeau.freevariable.com/static/201801/probabilistic-structures.pdf).  While I'm still improving at giving talks and designing visual explanations, I guess things haven't changed as radically as I might have assumed.
