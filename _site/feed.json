			"content_html": "<p>For nearly all of my adult life, a large part of my job has involved communicating technical concepts.  I like to imagine that I’ve developed a consistent voice, style, and visual language, and I’m also inclined to imagine that it has taken me a long time to get here.  I recently needed to look over an old deck and was surprised to note that many elements of my current (and presumably at least somewhat refined) style were present in a talk I gave over a decade ago as a graduate student.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~willb/dimple/ppdp07-talk.pdf\">the old talk</a>; for comparison, here’s <a href=\"https://chapeau.freevariable.com/static/201801/probabilistic-structures.pdf\">a talk I gave this January</a>.  While I’m still improving at giving talks and designing visual explanations, I guess things haven’t changed as radically as I might have assumed.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I was reminded today that the delights of good cookbooks subsist not merely in explaining how to prepare particular dishes of interest but in introducing wonderful things <em>that one didn’t even know were of interest</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is true of the best technical writing structured around a cookbook metaphor, as well.</p>\n",
