Former computer scientist, husband, dad, confessional Lutheran; often [capturing light](https://www.flickr.com/photos/willb/), [synthesizing sounds](https://soundcloud.com/willbenton), [rotating cogs](https://www.strava.com/athletes/642766), or [fitting curves](https://radanalytics.io).

(See also [Chapeau](https://chapeau.freevariable.com), where I occasionally write more than a few sentences about work.)
